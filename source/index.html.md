# DMN FEEL handbook

This is a vademecum for the FEEL expression language from the <a href="https://www.omg.org/dmn">DMN specification</a>, as also implemented by the <a href='https://www.drools.org/learn/dmn.html'>Drools DMN open source engine</a>.

This is not intented as an exahustive documentation of the DMN capabilities of Drools; this is intended as a handy a pocket reference for FEEL usage, a FEEL pocket guide, a FEEL reference, a FEEL quick reference, a FEEL cheatsheet,<br/>**a FEEL handbook**.

Looking for a gentle introduction to the DMN standard? We have just the right crash course on DMN, freely available for you at: <a href="https://learn-dmn-in-15-minutes.com">learn-dmn-in-15-minutes.com</a>.

You can refer to the complete <a href='https://www.drools.org/learn/documentation.html'>Drools DMN Engine documentation</a> on the main Drools website <a href='https://www.drools.org/learn/documentation.html'>here</a>.

The FEEL (Friendly Enough Expression Language) is intended as a common ground between business analysts, programmers, domain experts and stakeholders.

The FEEL language design include the following features:

 - Side-effect free
 - Simple data model with numbers, dates, strings, lists, and contexts
 - Simple syntax designed for a broad audience
 - Three-valued logic (`true`, `false`, `null`)

The following chapters presents basic FEEL syntax. You can refer to the other chapters for details of the built-in and extended FEEL functions.

# FEEL values

FEEL: supports the following data types:

- Numbers
- Strings
- Boolean values
- Dates
- Time
- Date and time
- Days and time duration
- Years and months duration
- Functions
- Contexts
- Ranges (or intervals)
- Lists

## number

> Examples:

```FEEL,justValid
47
-9.123
1.2*10**3 // expression resulting in 1.2e3
```

Numbers in FEEL are based on the <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4610935/">IEEE 754-2008</a> Decimal 128 format, with 34 digits of precision. Internally, numbers are represented in Java as `BigDecimals` with `MathContext DECIMAL128`. FEEL supports only one number data type, so the same type is used to represent both integers and floating point numbers.

FEEL numbers use a dot (`.`) as a decimal separator. FEEL does not support `-INF`, `+INF`, or `NaN`. FEEL uses `null` to represent invalid numbers.

FEEL specification does not support a literal scientific notation. E.g., `1.2e3` is not valid FEEL syntax. You can use `1.2*10**3` instead.

Drools extends the DMN specification and supports additional number notations:

- **Scientific**: You can use scientific notation with the suffix `e<exp>` or `E<exp>`. For example, `1.2e3` is the same as writing the expression `1.2*10**3`, but is a literal instead of an expression.
- **Hexadecimal**: You can use hexadecimal numbers with the prefix `0x`. For example, `0xff` is the same as the decimal number `255`. Both uppercase and lowercase letters are supported. For example, `0XFF` is the same as `0xff`.
- **Type suffixes**: You can use the type suffixes `f`, `F`, `d`, `D`, `l`, and `L`. These suffixes are ignored.

## string

> Example:

```FEEL,justValid
"John Doe"
```

Strings in FEEL are any sequence of characters delimited by double quotation marks.

## boolean

> Example:

```FEEL,justValid
true
```

FEEL uses three-valued boolean logic, so a boolean logic expression may have values `true`, `false`, or `null`.

## date

> Example:

```FEEL,justValid
date( "2017-06-23" )
```

Date literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in `date()` function to construct date values.
Date strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#date">XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes</a> document.
The format is `"YYYY-MM-DD"` where `YYYY` is the year with four digits, `MM` is the number of the month with two digits, and `DD` is the number of the day.

Date objects have time equal to `"00:00:00"`, which is midnight. The dates are considered to be local, without a timezone.

> Semantic of date properties; examples:

```FEEL
date( "2022-12-31" ).year = 2022
date( "2022-12-31" ).month = 12
date( "2022-12-31" ).day = 31
date( "2017-11-08" ).weekday = 3
```

You can access `year`, `month`, `day`, `weekday` properties on a `date` value, for the values of its named components.

## time

> Examples:

```FEEL,justValid
time( "04:25:12" )
time( "14:10:00+02:00" )
time( "22:35:40.345-05:00" )
time( "15:00:30z" )
time( "09:30:00@Europe/Rome" )
```

Time literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in `time()` function to construct date values.
Time strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#time">XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes</a> document.
The format is `"hh:mm:ss[.uuu][(+-)hh:mm]"` where `hh` is the hour of the day (from `00` to `23`), `mm` is the minutes in the hour, and `ss` is the number of seconds in the minute. Optionally, the string may define the number of milliseconds (`uuu`) within the second and contain a positive (`+`) or negative (`-`) offset from UTC time to define its timezone.
Instead of using an offset, you can use the letter `z` to represent the UTC time, which is the same as an offset of `-00:00`.
Instead of using an offset, you can also use the symbol `@` followed by a IANA timezone.
If no offset is defined, the time is considered to be local.

Time values that define an offset or a timezone cannot be compared to local times that do not define an offset or a timezone.

> Semantic of time properties; examples:

```FEEL
time( "13:20:00-05:00" ).hour = 13
time( "13:20:00-05:00" ).minute = 20
time( "13:20:00-05:00" ).second = 0
time( "13:20:00-05:00" ).time offset = duration("PT-5H")
time( "13:20:00@Europe/Rome" ).timezone = "Europe/Rome"
time( "13:20:00@Etc/UTC" ).timezone = "Etc/UTC"
time( "13:20:00@Etc/GMT" ).timezone = "Etc/GMT"
```

You can access `hour`, `minute`, `second`, `time offset`, `timezone` properties on a `time` value, for the values of its named components.

## date and time

> Examples:

```FEEL,justValid
date and time( "2017-10-22T23:59:00" )
date and time( "2017-06-13T14:10:00+02:00" )
date and time( "2017-02-05T22:35:40.345-05:00" )
date and time( "2017-06-13T15:00:30z" )
date and time( "2017-06-13T09:30:00@Europe/Rome" )
```

Date and time literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in `date and time()` function to construct `date and time` values.
Date and time strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime">XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes</a> document.
The format is `"<date>T<time>"`, where `<date>` and `<time>` follow the prescribed XML schema formatting, conjoined by `T`.

> Semantic of date and time properties; examples:

```FEEL
date and time( "2016-07-29T05:48:23.765-05:00" ).year = 2016
date and time( "2016-07-29T05:48:23.765-05:00" ).month = 7
date and time( "2016-07-29T05:48:23.765-05:00" ).day = 29
date and time( "2016-07-29T05:48:23.765-05:00" ).weekday = 5
date and time( "2016-07-29T05:48:23.765-05:00" ).hour = 5
date and time( "2016-07-29T05:48:23.765-05:00" ).minute = 48
date and time( "2016-07-29T05:48:23.765-05:00" ).second = 23
date and time( "2016-07-29T05:48:23.765-05:00" ).time offset = duration("PT-5H")
date and time( "2018-12-10T10:30:00@Europe/Rome" ).timezone = "Europe/Rome"
date and time( "2018-12-10T10:30:00@Etc/UTC" ).timezone = "Etc/UTC"
```

You can access `year`, `month`, `day`, `weekday`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`, `time offset`, `timezone` properties on a `date and time` value, for the values of its named components.

## days and time duration

> Examples:

```FEEL,justValid
duration( "P1DT23H12M30S" )
duration( "P23D" )
duration( "PT12H" )
duration( "PT35M" )
-duration( "P23D" )
```

Days and time duration literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in `duration()` function to construct `days and time duration` values.
Days and time duration strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration">XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes</a> document, but are restricted to only days, hours, minutes and seconds. Months and years are not supported.

> Semantic of days and time duration properties; examples:

```FEEL
duration( "P2DT20H14M" ).days = 2
duration( "P2DT20H14M" ).hours = 20
duration( "P2DT20H14M" ).minutes = 14
duration( "P2DT20H14M5S" ).seconds = 5
```

You can access `days`, `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, properties on a `days and time duration` value, for the values of its named components.

## years and month duration

> Examples:

```FEEL,justValid
duration( "P3Y5M" )
duration( "P2Y" )
duration( "P10M" )
duration( "P25M" )
-duration( "P2Y" )
```

Years and time duration literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in `duration()` function to construct `years and month duration` values.
Days and time duration strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration">XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes</a> document, but are restricted to only years and months. Days, hours, minutes, or seconds are not supported.

> Semantic of years and month duration properties; examples:

```FEEL
duration( "P1Y" ).years = 1
duration( "P1Y" ).months = 0
```

You can access `years`, `months`, properties on a `years and month duration` value, for the values of its named components.

## function

> Example:

```FEEL,justValid
function(a, b) a + b
```

FEEL has function literals (or anonymous functions, lambda functions) that you can use to create functions. 

In the example, the FEEL expression creates a function that adds the parameters a and b and returns the result.

## context

> Example:

```FEEL,justValid
{ x : 5, y : 3 }
```

FEEL has `context` literals that you can use to create contexts. A `context` in FEEL is a list of key and value pairs, similar to maps in languages like Java.

In the example, the expression creates a context with two entries, `x` and `y`, representing a coordinate in a chart.

In DMN 1.2, another way to create contexts is to create an item definition that contains the list of keys as attributes, and then declare the variable as having that item definition type.

The Drools DMN API supports DMN `ItemDefinition` structural types in a `DMNContext` represented in two ways:

- User-defined Java type: Must be a valid JavaBeans object defining properties and getters for each of the components in the DMN `ItemDefinition`. If necessary, you can also use the `@FEELProperty` annotation for those getters representing a component name which would result in an invalid Java identifier.

- `java.util.Map` interface: The map needs to define the appropriate entries, with the keys corresponding to the component name in the DMN `ItemDefinition`.

## range (or interval)

> Example interval between 1 and 10, including the boundaries (a closed interval on both endpoints):

```FEEL,justValid
[ 1 .. 10 ]
```

> Example interval between 1 hour and 12 hours, including the lower boundary (a closed interval), but excluding the upper boundary (an open interval):

```FEEL,justValid
[ duration("PT1H") .. duration("PT12H") )
```

The syntax of a range is defined in the following formats:

![FEEL range ebnf](range_ebnf.png)

The expression for the endpoint must return a comparable value, and the lower bound endpoint must be lower than the upper bound endpoint.

You can use ranges in decision tables to test for ranges of values, or use ranges in simple literal expressions.

For example, the following literal expression returns `true` if the value of a variable `x` is between `0` and `100`:<br/>
`x in [ 1 .. 100 ]`

> Semantic of range properties; examples:

```FEEL
(1..10].start included = false
(1..10].start = 1
(1..10].end = 10
(1..10].end included = true
```

You can access `start`, `end`, `start included`, `end included`, properties on a `range` value, for the values of its named components.

## list

> Example:

```FEEL,justValid
[ 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
```

FEEL has `list` literals that you can use to create lists of items.
A `list` in FEEL is represented by a comma-separated list of values enclosed in square brackets.

> Example to return the second element of a list `x`:

```text
x[2]
```

> Example to return the second-to-last element of a list `x`:

```text
x[-2]
```

All lists in FEEL contain elements of the same type and are immutable.
Elements in a list can be accessed by index, where the first element is `1`.
Negative indexes can access elements starting from the end of the list so that `-1` is the last element.

Elements in a list can also be counted by the function count, which uses the list of elements as the parameter.
For example, the following expression returns `4`:<br/>
`count([ 2, 3, 4, 5 ])`

## Properties of FEEL values

When the type is `date and time`, `date`, `time`, `days and time duration`, `years and month duration` or `range`,
you can access the named components mentioned in each of the sections above.

The semantic of the component is:

- `year` is the year number, in the interval `[-999999999..999999999]`
- `month` is the month number, in the interval `[1..12]`, where `1` is January and `12` is December
- `day` is the day of the month, in the interval `[1 ..31]`
- `hour` is the hour of the day, in the interval `[0..23]`
- `minute` is the minute of the hour, in the interval `[0..59]`
- `second` is the second of the minute, in the interval `[0..60)`
- `weekday` is the day of the week, in the interval `[1..7]` where `1` is Monday and `7` is Sunday
- `time offset` is the duration offset corresponding to the timezone the date or date and time value represents. The time offset property returns `null` when the value instance does not have a time offset set
- `timezone` is the timezone identifier as defined in the IANA Time Zones database. The timezone property returns `null` when the value instance does not have an IANA timezone defined
- `years` the years component of a `years and month duration`
- `months` the months components of a `years and month duration` in the interval `[1..11]`
- `days` the days components of a `days and time duration`
- `hours` the hours component of a `days and time duration` in the interval `[0..23]`
- `minutes` the minutes component of a `days and time duration` in the interval `[0..59]`
- `seconds` the seconds component of a `days and time duration` in the interval `[0..60)`

# FEEL expressions

This chapter explores some of the most useful FEEL operators to build basic expressions.

## if expression

> Examples:

```FEEL,commented
if 20 > 0 then "YES" else "NO"   //➔ "YES"
if (20 - (10 * 2)) > 0 then "YES" else "NO"   //➔ "NO"
if (2 ** 3) = 8 then "YES" else "NO"   //➔ "YES"
if (4 / 2) != 2 then "YES" else "NO"   //➔ "NO"
```

You can use the `if expression` as the classic if-then-else operator in other languages.

<aside class="warning">
Please notice that the <code>else</code> part is always mandatory.
</aside>

## for expression

> Examples:

```FEEL,commented
for i in [1, 2, 3] return i * i   //➔ [1, 4, 9]
for i in 1..3 return i * i   //➔ [1, 4, 9]
for i in [1,2,3], j in [1,2,3] return i*j   //➔ [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 3, 6, 9]
for x in @"2021-01-01"..@"2021-01-03" return x + 1 //➔ [date("2021-01-02"), date("2021-01-03"), date("2021-01-04")]
```

You can use the `for expression` to produce new values based on the iteration context(s).

This is similar to list comprehension and mapping from Functional Programming.

## quantified expression

These operators (`some`, `every`) are similar to list comprehension for filtering from Functional Programming concepts.

### some (name) in (list) satisfies (predicate)

> Examples:

```FEEL,commented
some i in [1, 2, 3] satisfies i > 2   //➔ true
some i in [1, 2, 3] satisfies i > 4   //➔ false
```

You can use the `some` to check if at least some element satisfies specific conditions from iteration context(s) built from the supplied list.

### every (name) in (list) satisfies (predicate)

> Examples:

```FEEL,commented
every i in [1, 2, 3] satisfies i > 1   //➔ false
every i in [1, 2, 3] satisfies i > 0   //➔ true
```

You can use the `every` to check if all the elements satisfies specific conditions from iteration context(s) built from the supplied list.

## in expression

> Examples:

```FEEL,commented
1 in [1..10]   //➔ true
1 in (1..10]   //➔ false
10 in [1..10]   //➔ true
10 in [1..10)   //➔ false
```

You can use the `in expression` to check if a given value is matched by a specified range.

## Three-valued logic(and, or)

> Examples

```FEEL,commented
true and true   //➔ true
true and false and null   //➔ false
true and null and true   //➔ null
true or false or null   //➔ true
false or false   //➔ false
false or null or false  //➔ null
true or false and false   //➔ true
(true or false) and false   //➔ false
```

FEEL supports three-valued logic (3VL) semantic. You can use `and` and `or` as the classic and (`&&`), and or (`||`) boolean operators in other languages, with the addition that the result can evaluate to null.

<aside class="warning">
Please notice that <code>and</code> is evaluated before <code>or</code>.
</aside>

## String concatenation

> Examples

```FEEL
"some" + "string" = "somestring"
"very" + "long" + "word" = "verylongword"
```

In FEEL, string concatenation is done by using `+` character. 

# String functions

This chapter explores the DMN FEEL specification built-in functions for `string`s.

<aside class="notice">
In FEEL, Unicode characters are counted based on their code points.
</aside>

## substring( string, start position, length? )

> Examples:

```FEEL
substring( "testing",3 ) = "sting"
substring( "testing",3,3 ) = "sti"
substring( "testing", -2, 1 ) = "n"
substring( "\U01F40Eab", 2 ) = "ab"
```

If a context item contains additional entries beyond the required "key" and "value" entries, the additional entries are ignored.
If a context item is missing the required "key" and "value" entries, the final result is null.
See also: get entries() built-in function.

## context put( context, key, value )

> Examples:

```FEEL
context put({x:1}, "y", 2) = {x:1, y:2}
context put({x:1, y:0}, "y", 2) = {x:1, y:2}
context put({x:1, y:0, z:0}, "y", 2) = {x:1, y:2, z:0}
```

Returns a new context that includes the new entry, or overrides the existing value if an entry for the same key already exists in the supplied context parameter.
A new entry is added as the last entry of the new context.
If overriding an existing entry, the order of the keys maintains the same order as in the original context.

## context put( context, keys, value )

> Examples:

```FEEL
context put({x:1}, ["y"], 2) = context put({x:1}, "y", 2)
context put({x:1}, ["y"], 2) = {x:1, y:2}
context put({x:1, y: {a: 0} }, ["y", "a"], 2) = context put({x:1, y: {a: 0} }, "y", context put({a: 0}, ["a"], 2))
context put({x:1, y: {a: 0} }, ["y", "a"], 2) = {x:1, y: {a: 2} }
context put({x:1, y: {a: 0} }, [], 2) = null
```

| Parameter          | Type                                            |

| `keys`          | `list` of `string`                                     |
| `value`          | `Any` type                                     |

Returns the composite of nested invocations to `context put()` for each item in `keys` hierarchy in context.

If `keys` is a list of 1 element, this is equivalent to `context put(context, key', value)`, where `key'` is the only element in the list keys.

If `keys` is a list of 2 or more elements, this is equivalent of calling `context put(context, key', value')`, with: <br/>
`key'` is the head element in the list keys, <br/>
`value'` is the result of invocation of `context put(context', keys', value)`, where: <br/>
`context'` is the result of `context.key'`, <br/>
`keys'` is the remainder of the list keys without the head element `key'`.

If `keys` is an empty list or null, the result is null.

## context merge( contexts )

> Examples:

```FEEL
context merge([{x:1}, {y:2}]) = {x:1, y:2}
context merge([{x:1, y:0}, {y:2}]) = {x:1, y:2}
```

| Parameter          | Type                                            |
|-|-|

Returns a new context that includes all entries from the given contexts; if some of the keys are equal, the entries are overridden.
The entries are overridden in the same order as specified by the supplied parameter, with new entries added as the last entry in the new context.

# Miscellaneous functions

These functions provide support utilities for several miscellaneous use-cases.
For example, when a decision depends on the current date, like deciding the support SLA over the weekends, additional charges for weekend delivery, etc.

It is important to note that the functions in this section are intended to be side-effect-free, but they are not deterministic and not idempotent from the perspective of an external observer.

As a user, you are encouraged to isolate the decision logic that uses these functions in specific DRG elements, such as Decisions.
The encapsulation enables them to be overridden with synthetic values during scenario testing, that remain constant across executions of the DMN model's test cases.

## now()

> Examples:

```FEEL,justValid
now()
```

Returns the current `date and time`.

## today()

> Examples:

```FEEL,justValid
today()
```

Returns the current `date`.

# KIE Extended functions

These functions are provided as an extension to the DMN Standard to enable support for various use-cases on top of the <a href='https://www.drools.org/learn/dmn.html'>Drools DMN Engine</a>.

## invoke( namespace, modelName, decisionName, parameters )

> Examples:

```text
invoke(
